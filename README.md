# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction data and building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or not based on various flight-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle - [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
- **Rows**: ~100,000
- **Features**: Flight Distance, Inflight Services, Seat Comfort, Type of Travel, Class, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Uncovered correlations between satisfaction and features like seat comfort, service, delay times.
- Visualized distribution of satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers across classes and travel types.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## ✅ Results
- Best model: **Random Forest**
- **Accuracy**: 93%
- **Precision**: 91%
- **Recall**: 92%
